# mancala-game-project
Mancala Game is a two-player game, each one has 6 pockets in front of him and his mancala, each pocket has 4 stones in it, and he is allowed to choose any pocket of the 6 to make his move (as long as this pocket is not empty), The goal is to collect the biggest number of stones in your own mancala. The game has 2 modes, with stealing and without stealing, without stealing means that the player cannot steal stones from his opponent pockets no matter what the situation, with stealing means that the player can steal from his opponent pockets ONLY IF he placed his last stone in an empty pocket (of his own pockets) and the opposite opponent pocket’s has stones in it, so the player will take the stone he put in the empty place and the stones in the opposite opponent’s pocket and put them in his mancala.
